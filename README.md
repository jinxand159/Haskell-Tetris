# Haskell-Tetris
A three passionate young students that want to create their favorite game in a language like Haskell.

You are welcome to download and try our game, although we think it is perfect you can always suggest different changes through this page.
Some of the features added are the shadow of the blocks, as it is shown in the images. 
:) Hope You enjoy it cause We did. <3
